# GARCH-Modeling-Using-GTBank-Monthly-Close-Share-Price
This is a repository to enable me investigate using GARCH modeling to analyse the GTBank (Nigerian Bank) monthly close share price.
I would appreciate if you could investigate this data and provide a more appropraite model for the time series.

The data provided are 
1. GTBank daily share price data (17 Feb 2003 - 11 August 2017)
2. GTBank month close share price data (Feb 2003 - March 2017)

I have also provided the R script I used in attempting to model the Time series derived from modeling the GTBank month close share price time series.
